# Modules

# Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
# A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.


# Simplification: A module often concentrates on one comparatively small area 
# of the overall problem instead of the full task.
# We will have a more manageable design problem to think about if we are only 
# concentrating on one module.

# Reusability: Functions created in a particular module may be readily accessed 
# by different sections of the assignment.

# Easy to  find error

# find area and perimeter of  a circle
