# NumPy Array Indexing

# Access Array Elements
# Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element.

# You can access an array element by referring to its index number.

# The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, 
# and the second has index 1 etc.

# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
# print(arr[0])
# print(arr[1])
# print(arr[2] + arr[3])


# Access 2-D Arrays
# To access elements from 2-D arrays we can use comma 
# separated integers representing the dimension and the index of the element.

# Think of 2-D arrays like a table with rows and columns, where the dimension represents the 
# row and the index represents the column.

# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])
# print('2nd element on 1st row: ', arr[0, 1])
# print('5th element on 2nd row: ', arr[1, 4])



# Access 3-D Arrays
# To access elements from 3-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing 
# the dimensions and the index of the element.

# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
# print(arr[0, 1, 2])


# Negative Indexing
# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])
# print('Last element from 2nd dim: ', arr[1, -1])
